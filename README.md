## About The Project

This project delves into the intricate world of health data to understand the multifaceted nature of obesity. Using a dataset of 2,111 individuals, I've applied machine learning to identify patterns and predictors of obesity, contributing to broader efforts in health awareness and prevention.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Dataset Analysis:** Leveraging a dataset rich in lifestyle and health attributes to unravel the complexity of obesity.
- **BMI-based Obesity Assessment:** Utilizing BMI levels as a primary measure for determining obesity risk.
- **Machine Learning Insights:** Employing ensemble machine learning methods to predict obesity risk with high accuracy.
- **Health Awareness:** Highlighting the importance of understanding obesity's risk factors and advocating for preventive measures.

### Built With

This project utilizes Python and an array of data science libraries, including:

- Pandas & NumPy for data management.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for insightful data visualizations.
- Scikit-learn for predictive modeling and analysis.

## Getting Started

To dive into this project and explore the models, follow these steps to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a Python environment ready (using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is recommended).

- Install the necessary Python packages:
  
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yonilev2003/Assessing-Obesity-Risk-With-ML.git
   ```
2. Install Python packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Exploring the Project

This project includes a detailed Jupyter notebook that guides through the dataset exploration, machine learning model development, and evaluation. It's a resource for data scientists, healthcare professionals, or anyone interested in the application of ML in health.
